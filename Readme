# ChainBattles: A Dynamic On-Chain NFT Game

ChainBattles is a smart contract that creates **dynamic NFTs** representing "Warrior" characters for a blockchain-based game. The contract allows players to mint their warriors, train them to increase their levels, and dynamically updates the metadata, all stored completely on-chain.

---

## Features

- **ERC-721 NFTs**: Fully compliant with the ERC-721 standard using OpenZeppelin's libraries.
- **Dynamic Metadata**: Token images and metadata are generated and updated entirely on-chain.
- **On-Chain Attributes**: Warriors start at level 0 and can be trained to increase their levels.
- **SVG Images**: NFTs include dynamically rendered SVG images showing the warrior's current level.

---

## How It Works

1. **Minting Warriors**  
   Use the `mint` function to create a new warrior NFT. Each NFT starts at level 0.

2. **Training Warriors**  
   Use the `train` function to increase the level of your warrior. Only the owner of the NFT can train it.

3. **Dynamic Updates**  
   The SVG image and metadata update in real-time as the warrior levels up.
